# Dotfiles

> [!WARNING]

All my dotfiles in one place.  This is very much a work in progress.

## After clone
```
$ cd ~/code/dotfiles
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ ./install.sh
```

### Note

Ensure that conflicting dot files/folders don't exist in your home folder
before running install.sh.
